# Codespace1

Experimenting with Github Codespaces to determine usefullness for:
  * Sharing code among team members
  * 

### [Quickstart Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/getting-started/quickstart)

**Considerations for team after experimenting**:
  * Is a Github Codespace powered by 100% renewables?
    * Which renewables (mix)?
    * Where (location)?
  * Data security and privacy?
    * Especially in regards to data entrusted to Ecotrust (*e.g.*, TEK/ITK)
  * ...TBD
